Redzone pulls publicly available severe weather outlooks from the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center office. The convective weather outlooks are overlayed on the map, allowing you to easily see risk forecasts relevant to you. Tap any outlook on the map to see details about what type of severe weather is forecast. Using your location (optional), Redzone will indicate which risk level currently exists at your location. Home Screen & Lock Screen widgets allow you to see a breakdown of today's or tomorrow's outlooks without the need to open the app.
